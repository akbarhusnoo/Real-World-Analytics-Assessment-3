# Real-World-Analytics-Assessment-3

As part of my master's degree, I had to complete this assessment in R Programming Language which focusses on understanding the data of the energy usage in a house, applying appropriate transformations on the chosen data, creating models of energy usage in the house as well as using the best fit model to predict energy usage for the house based on data inputs.

The average monthly temperature dataset utilised for this assessment was obtained from the Assessment Requirements. 

This assessment includes:
1. Plotting Histograms and Scatterplots for understanding and visualising the data;
2. Calculating Summary Measures;
3. Transformation of Data using Linear Feature Scaling, Log Transformation and Polynomial Transformations;
4. Fitting and Building Models using AggWaFit718.R;
5. Use the best fitting model for prediction;
6. Building a Linear Regression Model;
7. Comparison of Best Fitting Model and Linear Regression Model based on prediction accuracy.
